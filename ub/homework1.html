				<h1>Homework 1 - Your interests</h1>

				<p>I'm here to help you understand and pursue your interests, whether they're computing, soccer, drama, photography, or anything else. To help me help you, answer the following questions about your interests in life:</p>
 
				<ul>
					<li>What are your interests?</li>
					<li>How did you first become interested in them?</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>You'll use this brainstorming in the "About me" page of your web site we'll be working on in class tomorrow. Remember that this is open-ended: you can write about <em>any</em> of your interests, whether related to school or not.</p>
 
				<h2>What to Submit</h2>

				<p>Submit roughly 2-3 paragraphs of writing on a single page. It can be handwritten or printed. Include your name on your submission.</p>
				
				<h2>Grading (10 points)</h2>
				
				<p>There is no wrong answer about your interests. However:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>If you don't submit the homework, you'll get <strong>0 points</strong>.</li>
					<li>If you don't describe at least one interest, you'll get <strong>0 points</strong>.</li>
					<li>If you don't describe how you became interested, you'll lose <strong>5 points</strong>.</li>
				</ul>
