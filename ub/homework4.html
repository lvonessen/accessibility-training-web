				<h1>Homework 4 - Mentor</h1>

				<p>In your interest narrative, there was probably one person who was more influential in shaping your interest or disinterest in computing than others. In this homework, I'd like you to reflect more about that person&mdash;whether a family member, friend, teacher, or someone else&mdash;answering these five questions:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>When and where did you meet this person when they started helping you?</li>
					<li>In what ways did they help you?</li>
					<li>In what settings did you interact with that person?</li>
					<li>How frequently and for how long did you interact with that person?</li>
					<li>What is most important to you about that person?</li>
				</ul>

				<p>If you don't know where to begin, it's useful to think about your interactions with your mentor as a story. It's okay if your mentor didn't help you that much, or they weren't that important to you. You can write about that as well.</p>

				<p><strong>Note</strong>: if you aren't comfortable with sharing your own story, you aren't obligated to. Instead, you can further interview the same person you wrote about in Homework 2 (e.g., a brother, sister, or friend) and write about one of their mentors.</p>
				
				<h2>What to Submit</h2>
				<p>Submit one page that includes answers to the questions above. This list can be handwritten or printed. Include your name on your submission.</p>

				<h2>Grading (10 points)</h2>
				<p>There is no wrong answer for this homework, so you'll get 10 points for submitting. However, for each of the five questions you don't answer, you'll lose <strong>2 points</strong>.</p>
