				<h1>Homework 2 - Your interests in computing</h1>
				
				<p>Reflecting on your past and future learning is a big part of being a great web designer. Many professionals reflect through journaling to help them make sense of their goals, and then share those journals online to document their journey.</p>
 
				<p>To practice this, brainstorm all of the events and people that you believe influenced your interest or disinterest in computing. Reflect as far back as you can remember about the events and people that had a positive, negative, or neutral impact on your interests in computing.</p>
 
				<p>Consider these questions while you brainstorm:</p>
 
				<ul>
					<li>When did you first interact with a computer (including smartphones)?</li>
					<li>Did someone introduce you to how to use computers? Who?</li>
					<li>What did you first use computers for? </li>
					<li>How has that changed since you first started?</li>
					<li>Have you learned to code at home or in school?</li>
					<li>Who taught you?</li>
					<li>What have you created with computers?</li>
					<li>With whom do you share what you create?</li>
					<li>How did the people who helped you influence your interest in computing?</li>
				</ul>
 
				<p>As you brainstorm this list, think about the friends, siblings, parents, teachers, and other mentors who helped you along the way, and the effect they had on your interest in computing. Don't be discouraged if you can't remember everything right away! Just start writing what you do remember, and we'll address the gaps later.</p>
 
				<p><strong>Note</strong>: if you aren't comfortable with sharing your own story, you can interview someone else (e.g., a brother, sister, or friend) and write about <em>their</em> interests in computing.</p>
 
				<p><strong>Note</strong>: if no one has helped you with computing, talk about people who <em>could</em> have, but didn't. Focus your brainstorming on why they didn't and how you might have changed that.</p>

				<p><strong>Note</strong>: you can include me or Leanne, if we've genuinely impacted your interests.</p>

				<p>You will use everything you brainstorm for this homework to design the second page of your website, an interest narrative.</p>

				<h2>What to Submit</h2>

				<p>A list of events and people who shaped your interest or disinterest in computing, roughly one page in length. This list can be handwritten or printed. Include your name on your submission.</p>
				
				<h2>Grading (10 points)</h2>

				<p>There is no wrong answer for this homework. However:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>If you don't submit the homework, you'll get <strong>0 points</strong>.</li>
					<li>If you don't describe the people who influenced your interest, you'll only get <strong>5 points</strong>.</li>
				</ul>
