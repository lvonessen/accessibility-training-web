				<h1>Homework 6 - Who can help</h1>
				
				<p>The final page you'll be adding to your website will be about accomplishing your goals. In this homework, brainstorm two things:</p>

				<ol>
					<li>Qualities of your "ideal" mentor to help you with your goals:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Are they an expert in something in particular?</li>
						<li>Are they your age or older?</li>
						<li>What kind of personality do they have?</li>
						<li>Are they a friend or an acquaintance?</li>
					</ul>
					<li>At least one person in your life who has some of these qualities. They might be:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Teachers</li>
						<li>Advisors</li>
						<li>Friends</li>
						<li>Family</li>
					</ul>
				</ol>

				<p>If you can't think about who might be a good mentor for you, try listing people who you could be a good mentor for. How would you make yourself available to them? What resources could you help them gain access to?</p>

				<h2>What to Submit</h2>
				
				<p>Submit one page that includes answers ideas about the two topics above. This list of ideas can be handwritten or printed. Include your name on your submission.</p>

				<h2>Grading (10 points)</h2>
					
				<p>You'll get <strong>5 points</strong> for describing your ideal mentor and <strong>5 points</strong> for sharing at least one person who could be your mentor (or one person you could mentor).</p
