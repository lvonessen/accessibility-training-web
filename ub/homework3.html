				<h1>Homework 3 - Critique</h1>
 
				<p>Critique is a central part of being a good web designer. Critique helps you find ways to improve both the content and design of a web site, so that content is easier to understand and more engaging.</p>
 
				<p>For this homework, I want you to get feedback on your interest narrative from at least one person that knows about your experiences with computing:</p>
 
				<ul>
					<li>Show the person your page and have them read it</li>
					<li>Ask them to: 1) ask questions about the content and 2) provide additional details you may have forgotten</li>
				</ul>
 
				<p>Write down these these questions, details, and improvements. You'll use this as a list of improvements to work on in class tomorrow.</p>

				<h2>What to Submit</h2>
				<p>Submit one page that includes:</p>
 
				<ol>
					<li>A description of who you had critique your page</li>
					<li>A list of the questions or missing details they identified</li>
				</ol>
 
				<p>This list can be handwritten or printed. Include your name on your submission.</p>

				<h2>Grading (10 points)</h2>
				<p>There is no wrong answer for this homework, so you'll get 10 points for submitting. However:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>If you don't describe who you got feedback from, you'll lose <strong>3 points</strong>.</li>
					<li>If you don't include a list of questions and details, you'll lose <strong>7 points</strong>.</li>
				</ul>
