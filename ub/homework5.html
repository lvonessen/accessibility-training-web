				<h1>Homework 5 - Goals</h1>
	
				<p>Because the web is always changing, every web designer is constantly learning new skills. To focus their learning, it's important for web developers to set learning goals.</p>
	
				<p>In this homework, I want you to brainstorm goals for what you could learn <strong>in the next year</strong> about computing, web design, or any of your other interests.</p>
	
				<p>Here are some questions to help your brainstorming about your interests:</p>
	
				<ul>
					<li>What skills would you like to learn?</li>
					<li>What would you like to do with your new skills?</li>
					<li>Who would you like to help with your new skills?</li>
				</ul>
	
				<p>Use the weekend to generate a list of at least five goals. They should focus on the next year, but you can also write bigger lifelong goals. Don't worry about develop plans for achieving the goals (we'll help you with that in class).</p>
				
				<h2>What to submit</h2>
	
				<p>Submit one page that includes at least five goals for the next year. This list can be handwritten or printed. Include your name on your submission.</p>
				
				<h2>Grading (10 points)</h2>
	
				<p>You'll get <strong>2 points</strong> for each goal you submit, for up to 10 points.</p>
