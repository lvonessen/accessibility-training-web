				<h3>Short Bio</h3>

				<p>Andrew J. Ko is an Associate Professor at the <a href="http://www.washington.edu">University of Washington</a> <a href="http://ischool.uw.edu/">Information School</a> and an Adjunct Associate Professor in <a href="http://cs.washington.edu">Computer Science and Engineering</a>. He directs the Code &amp; Cognition Lab, where he invents and evaluates interactions between people and code, spanning the areas of human-computer interaction, computing education, and software engineering. He is the author of over 90 peer-reviewed publications, 9 receiving best paper awards and 2 receiving most influential paper awards. In 2013, he co-founded <a href="http://www.answerdash.com">AnswerDash</a>, a SaaS company offering instant answers on websites using a selection-based search technology invented in his lab. In 2010, he was awarded an NSF CAREER award to support his research and teaching on evidence-based bug triage. He received his Ph.D. at the <a href="http://www.hcii.cs.cmu.edu">Human-Computer Interaction Institute</a> at <a href="http://www.cmu.edu">Carnegie Mellon University</a> in 2008. He received degrees in Computer Science and Psychology with Honors from <a href="http://www.oregonstate.edu">Oregon State University</a> in 2002.</p>

				<h3>Long Bio</h3>

				<p>I was born in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Ontario,+Oregon&sll=37.788081,-104.501953&sspn=38.763291,54.931641&ie=UTF8&z=13&iwloc=addr">Ontario, Oregon</a>, but grew up primarily in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=west+linn&sll=44.024804,-116.975703&sspn=0.069492,0.107288&ie=UTF8&z=12&iwloc=addr">West Linn, Oregon</a>, a suburb of Portland, and went to <a href="http://www.wlhs.wlwv.k12.or.us/">West Linn High School</a>. The school was fantastic and I had wonderful teachers, especially in math, science, and English. I spent much of my free time playing video games with friends, drawing, and writing code in BASIC, Pascal, C, and my  TI-85 to make fancy visualizations, games, and UI toolkits and drawing tools.</p>

				<p>
				Despite being admitted to several great universities out of state, I decided to stay in-state and attend <a href="http://oregonstate.edu/">Oregon State University</a>, where I majored in <a href="http://eecs.oregonstate.edu/">Computer Science</a> and <a href="http://oregonstate.edu/cla/psychology/">Psychology</a>. Early on, I got involved in the budding student chapter of the ACM, and after my first year, helped run the club and its activities around campus, including the ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest, a statewide software engineering contest, and a student taught course on 2D graphics rendering algorithms. At the same time, I joined <a href="http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~burnett/">Margaret Burnett</a>'s research group, and stayed for two years. In my senior year, I focused on my honors thesis project, advised largely by <a href="http://www.docbob.ca/">Bob Uttl</a>. I'd enjoyed doing research in computer science and psychology so much, I decided to apply to several graduate schools with a slant towards Human-Computer Interaction.</p>

				<p>Of all of the schools, the <a href="http://www.hcii.cmu.edu/">Human-Computer Interaction Institute</a> at <a href="http://www.cmu.edu">Carnegie Mellon University</a> was the best fit, and I started work right away with <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bam/">Brad Myers</a>, trying to find out what made debugging so difficult, and inventing technologies to make it easier. Just after proposing in 2006, I did a fantastic internship at <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx">Microsoft Research</a> in the <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/groups/hip/">Human Interactions in Programming</a> group, and became fascinated with the larger challenge of software design and all of the human and cooperative issues that make it such a challenging form of engineering practice. I graduated with my Ph.D. in Human-Computer Interaction in May of 2008.</p>

				<p>Just prior to graduating, I toured the country, giving invited talks and job interviews at labs and universities for about eight weeks. I interviewed at a range of places, including from conservative CS departments like <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley EECS</a> to much broader places like the <a href="http://ischool.uw.edu/">University of Washington Information School</a>, as well as <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx">Microsoft Research</a>, Redmond. In the end, I wanted to be in the Pacific Northwest, I wanted a strong mix of teaching and research, and I was fascinated by the challenge of helping to grow and envision a new academic unit, so I chose the <a href="http://ischool.uw.edu/">Information School</a> as my new home.</p>

				<p>The pre-tenure period of my faculty career was distinguished by wonderful Ph.D. students, supportive colleagues across HCI and software engineering in both academia and industry, and exciting growth in the Information School faculty in data science, HCI, data visualization, and several other fields. My own work continued to focus on developer tools, but began to incorporate more data science, investigating bug reporting from in a range of contexts, including open source, Agile teams, and private industry. While I did this work, I also developed a growing passion for research on the learning and teaching of computing, investigating new learning technologies and aspects of software engineering expertise. In 2013, I co-founded <a href="http://www.answerdash.com">AnswerDash</a> with Jake Wobbrock and Parmit Chilana. AnswerDash offered instant answers on websites using a selection-based search technology that was the centerpiece of Parmit's dissertation work.</p>

				<p>I was tenured in 2015. I finished my last day AnswewDash in December of 2015, resuming full-time faculty life, and began a new focus on computing education research, inventing more effective, equitable, and scalable technologies and pedagogies for learning computer science.</p>

				<h3>Academic Lineage</h3>
