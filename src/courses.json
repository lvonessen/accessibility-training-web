However, this structure is especially important when people canâ€™t see the page, because the two dimensional page that eyes can easily skim otherwise becomes a linear stream of words read aloud by a screen reader (software commonly used by people who are blind or have dyslexia). However, there are ways to expose this structure to screen readers, allowing more targeted navigation of content.",
