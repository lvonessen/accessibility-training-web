<p><span>*(</span><a href=\"http://teachaccess.org/about/\"><span>http://teachaccess.org/about/</span></a><span>). </span></p> <p><em><span>&ldquo;People have all kinds of ability. If you design without accounting for variation in ability, your design will fail. Designs that account for all abilities are called accessible designs.&rdquo; (Andy Ko)</span></em></p> <p><span>According to the World Health Organization,</span></p> <p><span>&ldquo;Disability is not just a health problem. It is a complex phenomenon, reflecting the interaction between features of a person&rsquo;s body and features of the society in which he or she lives.&rdquo;</span></p> <p><span>To put this more concretely, not being able to hear your conversational partner is no hindrance if you are speaking to each other in sign language.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p>  
<h3><strong>There are many different kinds of abilities and disabilities (visual, hearing, cognitive, motor, etc), and all of these can range from situational to permanent. </strong></h3> 
<p><span>One way to convey the wide range of abilities and disabilities is to show students examples in each of these categories:</span></p> <ul> <li><span>Vision</span></li> <ul> <li><span>Blind</span></li> <li><span>Low-Vision</span></li> <li><span>Color Blind</span></li> </ul> <li><span>Hearing</span></li> <ul> <li><span>Deaf</span></li> <li><span>Hard of Hearing</span></li> </ul> <li><span>Speech</span></li> <ul> <li><span>Ability to speak</span></li> <li><span>Speed impediments</span></li> </ul> <li><span>Mobility</span></li> <ul> <li><span>Ability to walk</span></li> <li><span>Ability to use limbs</span></li> </ul> <li><span>Cognitive</span></li> <ul> <li><span>Dyslexia, dysgraphia, dyscalculia</span></li> <li><span>ADHD</span></li> <li><span>Memory loss</span></li> <li><span>Learning disabilities</span></li> </ul> <li><span>Behavioral</span></li> <ul> <li><span>Bipolar</span></li> </ul> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span>Another is to share statistics on their prevalence:</span></p> <ul> <li><span>About 1 in 7 worldwide have a disability</span></li> <li><span>More than 15% of K12 students have a disability</span></li> <ul> <li><span>Source: Reports of IEP and Section 504 accommodations from U.S. public schools. (via Andy Ko&rsquo;s slides)</span></li> </ul> <li><span>Graph of percentages from U.S. Census Bureau from 2002: (via Andy Ko&rsquo;s slides)</span></li> </ul> <p><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></p> <p><span>To illustrate how these (dis)abilities can be situational, temporary, and permanent, this graphic may help (source: </span><a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/design/inclusive\"><span>https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/design/inclusive</span></a><span>). The graphic doesn&rsquo;t include cognitive impairments, but being tired or drunk would be a situational variant, while chronic sleep deprivation (due to being a new parent for example) would be temporary, whereas dyslexia or Down syndrome are permanent.</span></p> <p><span>The following anecdote shows why the concept of an &ldquo;average&rdquo; person can be misleading (more details here: </span><a href=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/insight/2016/01/16/when-us-air-force-discovered-the-flaw-of-averages.html\"><span>https://www.thestar.com/news/insight/2016/01/16/when-us-air-force-discovered-the-flaw-of-averages.html</span></a><span>): </span></p> <p><span>In 1950 the US Air Force was trying to figure out how to redesign airplane cockpits to reduce accidents, and decided to take over 4000 pilots and average their measurements along 140 different metrics, such as thumb length, crotch height, and the distance from a pilot&rsquo;s eye to his ear, in order to design a cockpit to fit the average pilot. However, one of their scientists had doubts about this method, so he chose ten metrics that he thought would be most important for the design, generously defined average to be in the middle 30% around the average for each of the ten dimensions, and found that not one of the measured pilots fit those criteria. Even if he only chose three dimensions, only 3.5% of pilots were &ldquo;average.&rdquo;</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h3><strong>There are a number of different models through which one can consider people with disabilities, such as medical, education, rehabilitation, legal, sociocultural.</strong></h3> <ul> <li><span>A medical lens considers people with disabilities as patients who need treatments or cures, for example through medication. </span></li> <li><span>An education lens looks at ways to educate people with disabilities differently to take into account their different abilities, for example through schools for the deaf or special education. </span></li> <li><span>A rehabilitation lens looks at providing technology or training to allow people with disabilities to secure employment and care for themselves. </span></li> <li><span>A legal lens considers rights and responsibilities of people with disabilities, such as access to buildings, education, voting, etc. </span></li> <li><span>The sociocultural lens sees variation in ability is natural, and claims disability is caused by how society is designed, not by nature. </span></li> </ul> <p><span>In modern disability studies the sociocultural lens tends to be preferred because it captures some of the others such as legal and education, but doesn&rsquo;t frame a difference in ability as something wrong with the person that needs to be fixed, as the medical model might encourage. </span></p> <p><span>(source: slides from Andy Ko: </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kdh_ldE5jZboB2vuVejrVfLOlK0JajWd34RdJDX-mUA\"><span>https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kdh_ldE5jZboB2vuVejrVfLOlK0JajWd34RdJDX-mUA</span></a><span>) </span></p>
